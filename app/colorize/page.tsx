              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Sharp, well-exposed photos with clear details produce the most realistic colorization. Blurry or very

              <p className="text-gray-600">
                The AI performs exceptionally well on familiar subjects like people, nature, buildings, and everyday

                Photos with clear context clues - like outdoor settings, recognizable clothing styles, or familiar
                objects - help the AI make more accurate color choices.
