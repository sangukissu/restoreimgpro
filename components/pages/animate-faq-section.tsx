      question: "What types of photos work best for animation?",

      question: "How long does it take to generate an animated video?",

      question: "Can I use the Old Photo Revival template for modern photos?",
      answer: "While the template is optimized for vintage photos, it can be applied to modern photos as well. However, the best results are achieved with older, vintage-style photographs."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the maximum file size for uploaded photos?",
      answer: "You can upload images up to 20MB in size. Supported formats include JPG, PNG, and WebP. For best results, we recommend images with at least 1024Ã—1024 pixel resolution."
    },
    {
      question: "Are my photos stored on your servers?",
      answer: "No, your photos are processed securely and are not permanently stored on our servers. They are automatically deleted after processing is complete."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I download the animated videos?",
